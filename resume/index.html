      </dl>
      <p>Quilt Generator is a procedural quilt pattern generator implemented in JavaScript.  By changing parameters, such as the types of block patterns, the color palette, and the frequency that each is repeated, the code generates a unique quilt pattern. The generator can match up edges to create cellular automata-like patterns. I created this generator with an intent to sew a real quilt based on one of these patterns.

      <p>Diary List is a single page webapp I designed and built using React and Firebase used to keep track of personal ideas and the events of the day. I created Diary List as an alternative to a long form personal diary and structured to-do list.

      <p>I re-built the campaign website for Elaine DiMasi, a primary candidate for the NY 6th congressional district. Through one-on-one conversations with Elaine, I built her a new website from scratch with an improved content management user interface, a robust calendar system, a more streamlined summary of her policies, and a platform-independent responsive design.
