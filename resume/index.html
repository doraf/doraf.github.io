      <!-- <h4>https://github.com/dorafc/p5-quilt</h4> -->
      <p>Quilt generator is a procedural quilt pattern generator implemented in JavaScript.  By changing parameters, such as the types of block patterns, the color pallete, and the frequency that each is repeated, the code generates a unique quilt pattern. The generator can match up edges, to create cellular automata-like patterns. I created this generator with an intent to sew a real quilt based on one of these patterns.</p>

      <!-- <h4>https://github.com/dorafc/DiaryList</h4> -->
      <p>Diary List is a single page webapp I designed and built using React and Firebase used to keep track of personal ideas and the events of the day. I created Diary List as an alternative to a long form personal diary and structured to-do list.</p>

      <!-- <h4>https://elainedimasi.com</h4> -->
      <p>I re-built campaign website for Elaine DiMasi, a primary candidate for the NY 6th congressional district. I worked with the candidate to understand how her website needed to fit the communications needs of the campaign and how she was underserved by her previous website. The new website had a robust events calendar system, better content management tools, and a more polished responsive design that could be viewed across many devices.</p>
